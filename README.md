# Real-Estate-Scraper
Real estate scraper for popular real estate websites in Lithuania, aggregates all data into MongoDB database
Currently only works for Aruodas.lt, 
Aruodas is leader by far in ads, so it still basically represents majority of real estate ads in Lithuania.
Project is built with idea in mind to create machine learning model for price prediction.
This project uses selenium, so it scrapes javascript generated content as well,
It bypasses cloudflare bot protection using undetected chromedriver.
